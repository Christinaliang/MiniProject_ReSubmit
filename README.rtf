This demo utilzed REFUGE challenge database. 
The REFUGE challenge is a segmenation challenge, segmenting optic disc from other parts of retina on fundus images.


TO RUN:
1:Download every file and two image forlders;
2:Open "main.mlx";
3:Change working path under Matlab accordingly;
4:I suggest you only download five PAIRS of images and truths for just a quick demo. 
By pair, image and truth need to have same name.
